# Pomodoro Focus Tracker

Personal productivity tool built to explore Angular + AWS Amplify architecture 
while solving a real problem: understanding where my focused time actually goes.

🌐 **Live Demo:** [https://focusgo.app](https://focusgo.app)

## Why This Project?

I built this as both a personal productivity tool and a learning laboratory while writing my 7th technical book, "AI Security for .NET Developers."

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Core Pomodoro timer functionality
- ✅ Progressive Web App (works offline, installs on devices)
- ✅ Material Design UI
- ✅ AWS Amplify serverless deployment
- 🔄 **Exploring AI integration** for time pattern analysis

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Angular 17 + Angular Material
- **Hosting:** AWS Amplify (serverless)
- **Future:** Evaluating AI APIs for time analysis features

## What I'm Learning

### Amplify Architecture
This project let me explore AWS Amplify's serverless architecture with Angular:
- Amplify Hosting for static Angular apps
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Environment-based configuration
- Cost-effective hosting for personal projects

### AI Integration Exploration (In Progress)
Currently evaluating different approaches for adding AI-powered time analysis:
- Tested GitHub Models for initial prototyping
- Exploring cost/performance trade-offs of various AI APIs
- Researching security patterns for AI integration
- These learnings will inform the AI Security book

## Features

### Current
- ⏱️ Pomodoro timer with customizable intervals
- 📊 Session tracking
- 🎨 Material Design UI
- 📱 Responsive (works on mobile)
- 💾 Local data persistence

### Planned
- 🤖 AI-powered time pattern analysis
- 📈 Advanced analytics dashboard
- 🔄 Data export functionality
