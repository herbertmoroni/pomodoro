# Pomodoro Focus Tracker

Personal productivity tool built to explore Angular + AWS Amplify architecture 
while solving a real problem: understanding where my focused time actually goes.

🌐 **Live Demo:** [https://focusgo.app](https://focusgo.app)

## Why This Project?

I built this as both a personal productivity tool and a learning laboratory while writing my 7th technical book, "AI Security for .NET Developers."

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Core Pomodoro timer functionality
- ✅ Category/tag system for organizing sessions
- ✅ Session tracking with comprehensive metadata
- ✅ Progressive Web App (works offline, installs on devices)
- ✅ Material Design UI with toolbar
- ✅ AWS Amplify serverless deployment
- ✅ Firebase Authentication (Google sign-in)
- ✅ Cloud sync with Firestore
- ✅ User notifications with Material Snackbar
- ✅ Custom category management (add/edit/delete/reorder)
- 🔄 **Next: Analytics dashboard and AI integration**

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Angular 18 + Angular Material
- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth (Google OAuth)
- **Database:** Firebase Firestore
- **Hosting:** AWS Amplify (serverless)
- **Future:** AI APIs for time analysis features

## What I'm Learning

### Amplify Architecture
This project let me explore AWS Amplify's serverless architecture with Angular:
- Amplify Hosting for static Angular apps
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Environment-based configuration
- Cost-effective hosting for personal projects
- Firebase Crashlytics for tracking user errors in production (authentication failures, Firestore errors, etc.)

### AI Integration Exploration (In Progress)
Currently evaluating different approaches for adding AI-powered time analysis:
- Tested GitHub Models for initial prototyping
- Exploring cost/performance trade-offs of various AI APIs
- Researching security patterns for AI integration
- These learnings will inform the AI Security book


## Data Structure & AI Integration

### Session Tracking Architecture

The app tracks comprehensive session data designed for future AI analysis:

```typescript
interface PomodoroSession {
  id: string;
  categoryId: string;           // Tag/category for the session
  categoryName: string;          // Category name (for history if renamed)
  duration: number;              // Planned duration (seconds)
  actualDuration: number;        // Actual time spent
  startTime: string;             // ISO timestamp
  endTime: string;               // ISO timestamp
  completed: boolean;            // Natural completion vs skipped
  dayOfWeek: number;            // 0-6 for weekly patterns
  hourOfDay: number;            // 0-23 for daily patterns
  consecutiveSession: number;    // Session count in current streak
  followedBreak: boolean;        // Whether a break was taken before
}
```

### Why This Data Structure?

**For Personal Analytics:**
- Track time investment across different life areas (work, study, personal)
- Understand productivity patterns by time of day and day of week
- Measure focus sustainability (consecutive sessions, completion rates)
- Identify when breaks improve performance

**For AI-Powered Insights:**
The data structure is optimized for AI analysis to provide actionable insights:

#### Pattern Recognition
- "You complete 90% of Study sessions between 9-11 AM"
- "Your focus drops after 3 consecutive sessions without a break"
- "Tuesday mornings show highest completion rates for Work tasks"

#### Fatigue Detection
- "You skip 60% of sessions after the 4th consecutive pomodoro"
- "Taking breaks increases your next session completion rate by 25%"

#### Optimization Suggestions
- "Schedule Urgent tasks in the morning when your completion rate is highest"
- "Consider longer breaks after Study sessions - your data shows improved focus"
- "You work best in 2-3 session blocks with breaks between"

#### Smart Planning
- Suggest optimal times for specific categories based on historical performance
- Recommend break timing based on fatigue patterns
- Predict realistic daily capacity based on completion history

## SEO & Growth Roadmap

### Short Term (Easy Wins)
- Add Schema.org structured data (JSON-LD) for SoftwareApplication
- Create a blog section with productivity tips
- Add an about/features page (more indexable content)
- Implement breadcrumbs when you add more pages

### Long Term
- Content marketing - Write articles about productivity
- Backlinks - Submit to PWA directories
- Performance - Keep Lighthouse scores high (already good with PWA)
